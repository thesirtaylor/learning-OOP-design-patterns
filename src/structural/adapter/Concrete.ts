/**
 * In this example, both the Slack and MS Teams clients have different interfaces (postMessageToUserInChannel for Slack, postToChannel for MS Teams) than what our system expects (sendMessage).
 * So we create adapters (SlackAdapter and MSTeamsAdapter) that implement IMessageClient and delegate calls to the respective clientâ€™s method.
 * This way, our system can work with both Slack and MS Teams in a seamless way.
